📚 Library SQL Project

![image alt](https://github.com/srijantechie/Library_SQL_Project/blob/main/library.jpg?raw=true)


A robust SQL-based Library Management System built using PostgreSQL. This project simulates a real-world library database with relational integrity, covering operations such as book issues, returns, employee activity, overdue tracking, and performance reporting.



🚀 Project Highlights

1.Database Design: Structured with normalized tables for books, members, employees, branches, and transaction logs.

2.Data Manipulation: Includes comprehensive INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations with sample data for over 30 books, multiple branches, employees, and members.

3.Complex Queries: Implements advanced SQL operations like JOIN, GROUP BY, subqueries, CTAS, and date arithmetic.

4.Stored Procedures:

-issue_book: Automates the book issuance while validating availability.

-add_return_records: Updates return logs and changes book status.

5.Performance Reports:

-Branch-wise issued/returned count and revenue.

-Active members table creation.

-Top employees by book transactions.

-Overdue Detection: Identifies books not returned beyond a 30-day limit.

🌟 Impact Created

✅ Real-World Simulation: Replicates essential operations of a working library, providing hands-on experience with data modeling, inventory control, and member management.

🧠 Skill Enhancement: Reinforces knowledge of SQL fundamentals and advances users' abilities with stored procedures, aggregate reporting, and multi-table joins.

📈 Data-Driven Decisions: Enables insights into library performance, such as most issued books, branch efficiency, overdue trends, and active user behavior.

🔁 Automation & Integrity: Introduces automation through stored procedures to maintain data consistency and reduce manual error.

🎓 Educational Utility: Ideal for students, educators, and aspiring data professionals to use as a foundation for academic projects, assignments, or interview preparation.
